Import the BitmapFontImporter.cs file in your Unity Assets folder.
Then do a Right Click on the .xml (.font) file
Click Generate Bitmap Font
The Script should generate a .material and a .fontsettings file
Now we use the font you just created in your scene
Create an UI > Text game object in your scene
Select the UI Text game object
In the inspector go to the Text (Script) component and add the .fontsettings file in the Character >Font field
Then add the .mat file in the Material field.

NOTE: In Crash's Font, you must use only CAPITAL LETTERS to work.
