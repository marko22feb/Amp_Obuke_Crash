This entire folder and subfolders belong to one 3DS Max project.

* In the 'import' folder you'll find another folder called TwinSanitys Ripped Pack. This folder contains a lot of Crash Bandicoot Twin Sanity (CBTS) models ripped from PS2. 
  All models there are in .obj format. The ratio between those ripped models is 1:80. That is, ripped models are 80 times bigger than the correct ones that you'll use into your game or other aplication. To correct this, resize them to 20%.
* In the 'scenes' folder you'll find others models from CBTS. Many of them are property scaled and skinned;
* In 'sceneassets\images' folder are the textures used into models. They are categorized.
